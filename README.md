# python-mongotools
A small python library with tools to work with mongodb data.  I frequently dealt with timestamps from objectIds.  
I wanted a single function to call to generate _id values.


## Installation

The python-mongotools library can be installed via the distutils setup.py script
included at the root directory:

<code>
python setup.py install
</code>

##Usage
see example.py

## Dependencies

Required / Recommended libraries
* [python-bson] some functionality will work without this library
